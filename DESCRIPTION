Description: Using HTS data, clusters mutations in order to recreate putative
    clones from the data provided. It requires genotype at the location of the
    variant as well as the depth of coverage and number of reads supporting the
    mutation. Additional information may be provided, such as the contamination
    in the tumor sample. This package also provides a function QuantumCat() which
    simulates data obtained from tumor sequencing.
