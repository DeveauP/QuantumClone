\usage{
m.step(fik, Schrod, previous.weights, previous.centers, contamination,
  adj.factor, optim = "default", initialpop = NULL, itermax = NULL,
  epsilon)
}
\arguments{
\item{fik}{Matrix giving the probability of each mutation to belong to a specific clone}

\item{Schrod}{A list of dataframes (one for each sample), generated by the Patient_schrodinger_cellularities() function.}

\item{previous.weights}{Weights from the previous optimization step (used as priors for this step)}

\item{previous.centers}{Clone coordinates from previous optimization step (used as priors for this step)}

\item{contamination}{Numeric vector with the fraction of normal cells contaminating the sample}

\item{adj.factor}{Factor to compute the probability: makes transition between the cellularity of the clone and the frequency observed}

\item{optim}{use L-BFS-G optimization from R ("default"), or from optimx ("optimx"), or Differential Evolution ("DEoptim")}

\item{initialpop}{Previous population to reuse for genetic algorithm}

\item{itermax}{itermax parameter for DEoptim}

\item{epsilon}{Stop value: maximal admitted value of the difference in cluster position and weights 
between two optimization steps. If NULL, will take 1/(median depth).}
}
