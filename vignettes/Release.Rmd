Release of 19/08/2016
  - Corrected NMI computation if a number of cluster is missing (for example cluster values can be 1:3, 5:7, cluster value 6 would be considered missing)
  - Changed the proof of concept pipeline to be easier to read and edit
  - Changes in Probability.to.belong.to.clone: now returns filtered and unfiltered probabilities (clustering is on filtered probabilities)

Release of 16/08/2016
  - Corrected hard clustering parameters
  - Corrected probability.to.belong.to.clone
  - Gain from parallelization script

Release of 12/08/2016
  - Computed PoC for clustering quality
  - Changes in `eval.fik` for an expected 5-10% gain in computational speed.

Release of 9/08/2016
  - Removed 3D plots to prepare CRAN release

Release of 8/08/2016:
  - Removed rgl dependency (3D plots), causing QuantumClone to be unavailable on Ubuntu
  - Updated pipeline tests
  - Computational time test compiled
  - Ongoing:
    * Issue in the distance error (position of the cluster for drivers vs real position)
    * Compile Rmd for computational clustering quality results.
    

Release of 4/08/2016
  - Added function to easily compute Normalized Mutual Information from QuantumClone output - for simulated data.
  - Added pipelines to compare to paper pipeline

Release of 29/07/2016:

  - Option to force single copy status - i.e. integrate QuantumCloneSingle in QuantumClone
  - Perspectives:

    * tidy plot code in cluster_plot
    * Reproducible test in R (QC only)
    * Reproducible testing in R+bash (QC+sciclone+pyClone)

Release of 28/07/2016:

  - Added AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
  - Added modified BIC (user input)
  - Added possibility to use `optimx` instead of `optim` for the maximization step
  - Using `compiler` package to improve computing time
  - Improved code readability
  - Improved parallel computation handling
  - Solved conflicting name in simulation: cellularity of clone is now refered to as cellularit
  - Added option to keep all iteration models
  


Release of 10/12/2015:

  - Changed graph output to pdf
  - Fixed non-clustered graph name file

Release of 12/11/2015:

  - Added release tag on github
  - Checked for ggplot2 scheduled release

Release of 2/11/2015:

  - Correction of evolution plot
  - Adding content to vignettes
  - Added phylogenetic tree reconstruction and representation, along with examples
  - Added ImportFrom according to notes from R-devel: http://win-builder.r-project.org/

Release of 30/10/2015:

  * Major fix *
  - Post processing affected order of mutations but not of clustering. The clustering thus appeared erroneous in version 0.9.15 and 0.10.15

  * Minor changes *
  - Adding vignette release
  - Changed dependency of doSNOW to doParallel
  - Added data to decrease loading and check time
  - Added function to plot results from output (by 2 elements)
  - Added function to plot cellularity of clone in each sample (for time series, with proportion of mutation in each clone)
