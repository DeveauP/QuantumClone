## Additional information:

The code to generate the figure 3 takes ~ 15 - 20 minutes to run, take this into consideration before starting the "knitting". A solution to reduce 
computational time would be to reduce the number of clusters looked for in `nclone_range`, or increase the number of cores used to 
run the simulation.
